intersection:
either:
  is start
  is end
  track types: 2, 4, 5, 6
  (for collision: 3)

start at intersection
go one possible direction
collect and follow all "normal" tiles
end at next intersection
store collected "normal" tiles in new section

make sure only one section at once
start at first intersection (lowest X,Y)
go one direction (first of NESW)
map out section (s. above)
again from first intersection choose next lowest NESW, map out onwards
continue for each intersection foreach possible direction, but dont do sections multiple times


every "normal" tile can be only in one intersection (except track type #3)


intersection possible connections:
other intersection
non intersection

section:
has 2 ends, each connected to a respective intersection

TODO: (remove TID and only initiate with start and connect to end somehow)
from starting intersection of move, check next non-intersection cell in the section_cells and figure out what action is necessary; then add move_forward actions until target intersectio is reached
